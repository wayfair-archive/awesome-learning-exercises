📚 Exercise 1, Part 1 - Making Inputs Stateful 📚

  We've got a form with 3 fields, a person's full
  name, their phone number, and an email address.
  However, the inputs are not working; when we try to
  submit the form, it tells us that the fields are 
  empty. We can fix this by managing the state of
  the values using hooks.

  🛠️ Make all of the inputs stateful using the useState 
  🛠️ hook. When an input changes (onChange event), it 
  🛠️ should save the value to the state. The value of
  🛠️ an input should always come from state.

  💡 processForm takes an object of our 3 fields. 
  💡 If any of these fields are missing, it shows 
  💡 an alert to indicate this. If all fields have 
  💡 values when processForm is ran, processForm 
  💡 will show an alert with the contents of the fields

  💡 We provide a "Field" component which reduces some complexity
  💡 in how much code is necessary. Take a look to see how 
  💡 it functions, and what you will need to do to make its 
  💡 value stateful. You don't need to modify the Field component.
