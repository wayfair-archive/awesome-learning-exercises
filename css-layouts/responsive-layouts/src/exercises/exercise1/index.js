  💡 Welcome to the exercise portion of this course on Flexbox and responsive layouts

  💡 What you'll see below are a set of question components that contain
  💡 a Block component and some colored shape components. The Block component is the 
  💡 main layout component you'll be using in this course.

  💡  Instead of writing CSS, you'll specify props to the Block components which
  💡  add special CSS classes for the property. For example, if you want
  💡  to change the flex-direction of the content, you would set the `flexDirection`
  💡  prop to "row-reverse" (all props are camelcased, but the values are the normal 
  💡  CSS equivalent.

  💡  Take a look at the `grid-components.js` file to get a better idea of what
  💡  props are available, and what values they accept. If you notice, there 
  💡 are also width props to specify the size, we will get to those in exercise 2.

  💡 If you look at the browser panel on the right, you'll see a series of solid shapes
  💡 of different sizes and some dotted outlines of those shapes overlaid.

  💡 Those dotted outlines represent the final location location of where we want
  💡 the components to line up. The goal of this first exercise is to use the flex
  💡 props on the Block component to line up those solid shapes with the dotted ones.

  💡 Note: For this first exercise, you should not need to delete or add HTML elements
  💡 to the JSX to find a solution, only props.
