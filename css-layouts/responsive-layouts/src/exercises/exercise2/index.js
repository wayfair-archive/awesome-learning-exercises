  💡 Next, we're going to apply what we've learned about base-12 grids
  💡 to arrange some content blocks. 

  💡 The Block prop accepts either an integer representing a single width,
  💡 or an object representing the widths specified at certain breakpoints.

  💡 The breakpoints provided in the compoment are "small", "medium",
  💡 and "large". These are intended to match up to mobile devices, 
  💡 medium-range devices like tablets, and then desktops. 
  
  ℹ️ In practice, devices can have a large range of pixel sizes and 
  ℹ️ layout changes might be needed at a larger variety of pixel widths. 

  ⚠️ For example, if one were to pass in the following size object
  ⚠️ to the Block component:

  ```
  size={{
    small: 12
    medium: 6
    large: 4
  }}
  ```

  💡 The computed CSS would set the width for that element to be 100%
  💡 of the container at small range, half the width at medium range, 
  💡 and one-third of the width of the page at large range. The "small"
  💡 value represents the width that it should fall back to if a
  💡 width isn't specified for a smaller size. It works the same as passing in
  💡 only a single string value.

  💡 Setting a Block component's width to the value of '0' will hide
  💡 the element at that breakpoint. When developing a real-world application,
  💡 you most likely would not want to hide a component using CSS for
  💡 performance and accessibility reasons. For the sake of this exercise, 
  💡 this prop is used  to demonstrate the concept of certain content being 
  💡 visible or hidden for certain screen sizes or devices. 

  💡 In the JSX below, add the appropriate width props to the Block
  💡 components so that the layout matches the solution in the righthand
  💡 panel. 

  💡 The background color of the brick components will change at each breakpoint
  💡 to help clarify what size you're currently viewing. 
  💡 In addition, there's an indicator on the right of the exercise navigation bar.

  💡 Note: since this involves re-sizing the screen to confirm your results,
  💡 it is suggested that you open the browser view in a new window by clicking
  💡 the button located on the far right of the browser toolbar
