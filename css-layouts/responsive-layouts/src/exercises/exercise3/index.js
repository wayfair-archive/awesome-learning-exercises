  💡 For this final exercise, you will need to combine what
  💡 you learned from the first two exercises: the size prop,
  💡 and all of the various flex props to create a fully responsive
  💡 layout.

  💡 Below, you'll see a bunch of component imports that
  💡 are named after page elements you may see on a website
  💡 or application. These are what you'll be wrapping in 
  💡 `Block` components to replicate the layout you see
  💡 on the right side of the browser window.

  ⚠️ Much like the sizes prop, the flex props also accept
  ⚠️ an object of values. For example: 

  ```
    flexDirection={{
      small: "row",
      large: "column"
    }}
  ```

  💡 Would define the flex axis on the container to be "row" (vertically-aligned)
  💡 on small screens, and then "column" (horizontally-aligned) on large screens.

  💡 You may need to nest Block components inside other Block
  💡 components to achieve the desired layout.

  💡 Once again: since this involves re-sizing the screen to confirm your results,
  💡 it is suggested that you open the browser view in a new window by clicking
  💡 the button located on the far right of the browser toolbar
